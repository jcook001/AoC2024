My attempt at Advent of Code 2024

Running the project will launch a command window that asks which day you wolud like to solve.

With a lot of help from Chat GPT, that works dynamically for any day that's added to the project and the answers will be copied to your clipboard.
(If you don't use it already win + v will enable clipboard history on Windows, which will allow you to see/past both the answer for the first and second part of the puzzle)
